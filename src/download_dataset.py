"""
This module is for downloading the dataset from kaggle.
Problem statement: Housing price prediction using advanced regression
Dataset url: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques

Functions:

1. load_env_variable: I have stored kaggle api credentials inside .env file. By using python-dotenv
I have loaded those as environment variable in this function.

2. read_yml_file: I have the configuration related to dataset inside config/dataset_info.yml, using
this function, I read the constants.

3. unzip file: If the dataset is going to be downloaded as zip file, we can use this function to
unzip the downloaded file.

4. download_dataset: To download the dataset with appropriate arguments like command to download and
dataset storage path.

5. main: To assemble all the functions and call one by one.
